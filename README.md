**rover** is a *wip* interpreter, compiler, and runtime for mars.

*most of the code for this project was inspired by Robert Nystrom's amazing book, Crafting Interpreters.*

# Using rover

once you've got [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) on your machine, run `cargo build --release` to get a development version of rover that you can use to run mars source files. The cli takes only one argument: the path to the file to interpret: `rover <path>`.

# **Mars**
Mars is a minimal, dynamically-typed language, centered on simple abstractions and ease of use.
It is also not a serious project, mostly just a side hobby of mine, so don't judge it to harsh.
